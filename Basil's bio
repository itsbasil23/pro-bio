Hey My name is Basil. I previosly had finished highschool about 8 months ago and since then i had just been working and getting ready for the Year up program.
I am currently a student at Year Up in the App devlopment track. At Year Up i hope to pass all my classes and get an internship. I am also the older out of 4 of my other silbings
so being a good role model is something a work on everyday.
